# Awesome SSR [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Comprehensive list of resources (tools and learning material) to render JavaScript-generated-content to HTML.
To improve SEO, SMO, and performance.

The techniques to render JavaScript-generated-content to HTML are:

 - Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
 - Pre-Rendering
 - Static Site Generators

They are explained in the [Introduction](#introduction).

## Introduction

Modern frontends (React, Vue, Angular, ...) use JavaScript to load and display content.
Such JavaScript-generated-content is invisible to crawlers that don't execute JavaScript.
Most crawlers don't execute JavaScript.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Pre-Rendering, and Static Site Generators are techniques to render JavaScript-generated-content to HTML.
Making the content visible to crawlers.
It also improves performance.

### SEO

The Google crawler is
the only crawler that executes JavaScript.
All other crawlers rely on HTML exclusively.
If you want your content to be crawled by all other search engines (Bing, Baidu, DuckDuckGo, etc.), then your content needs to be included in your website's HTML.

Also, Google's capability to execute JavaScript has limitations.
(See the Google I/O '18 talk [Deliver search-friendly JavaScript-powered websites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFwUbgvpdaQ).)
It is safer to include your content to your website's HTML
rather than to rely on Google's crawler to execute your website's JavaScript.

### SMO

The crawler of social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, ...) don't execute JavaScript and rely solely on HTML.

If you want your website to be correctly previewed when a user shares your website, then the corresponding information needs to be included in your website's HTML.

(SMO means "Social Media Optimization".)

### Performance

Rendering your website's pages to HTML decreases the perceived loading time:
Once the HTML is loaded, content can already be displayed before any JavaScript is loaded/executed.

The improvement is considerable on mobile
where loading/executing JavaScript is much slower.

### Techniques

There are two ways to render JavaScript-generated-content to HTML:

- **Directly render to HTML**
  <br/>
  Most modern view libraries (React, Vue, Angular, ...) can directly render to HTML (instead of rendering to the DOM).
  (E.g. a React component can be rendered to HTML with `require('react-dom/server').renderToStaticMarkup()`.)
- **Render to HTML via headless browser**
  <br/>
  A headless browser runs your website's JavaScript,
  the website's pages are rendered to the DOM of the headless browser,
  and HTML is automatically generated from the resulting DOM.

Leading to the following techniques:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
  <br/>
  Directly render your website's pages to HTML at request-time:
  Every time a user requests a page, the server renders the page directly to HTML.
  <br/>
  SSR is the most reliable option if your HTML changes frequently.
  (If your website's content may change after deploy-time,
  e.g. if you website's content is generated by users.)
- **Pre-Rendering**
  <br/>
  A headless browser crawls your website, executes the website's JavaScript, and generates HTML upon the resulting DOM.
  Instead of using a headless browser,
  some pre-renderers directly render your pages to HTML.
- **Static Site Generators**
  <br/>
  A static website is a website that doesn't have any server code:
  The website is composed of static browser assets only (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, ...).
  Some generators can directly render views to HTML:
  When your website is built, each page is rendered to a HTML file that includes all the page's content.
  <br/>
  If your content may only change at deploy-time, then using a Static Site Generator is an option.
